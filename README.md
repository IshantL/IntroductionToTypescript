# Introduction To Typescript

## Why Typescript
There are some problems with JavaScript 
- there is no strong type checking available in js
- we can add properties inthobject on fly
- we can assisgn the same variable as number, string, objects etc.

## How Typescript works

- As the browser only understand the JS
- We can use compilation process i.e anylanguage(typescript) -> Compiler/transpiler -> JS file 
- it is on development time

## Typescript vs javascript
- Typrscript -> JS + types (and some other stuffs)
- we can use es6 in typescript , as es6 may be not use in all browsers but typescript convert from ts to js, we can use mordern syntax inside it.
- makes building these complex apps more managable.

## Setup 
- VS Code
- Node js (to convert from ts to js and to run js)
- npm install -g install typescript

## to run the ts file
 - $tsc "file name"
